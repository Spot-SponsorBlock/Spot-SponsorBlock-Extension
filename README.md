Spot SponsorBlock is an open-source crowdsourced browser extension to skip sponsor segments in Spotify podcasts. Users submit when a sponsor happens from the extension, and the extension automatically skips sponsors it knows about. It also supports skipping other categories, such as intros, outros and self promotions.
